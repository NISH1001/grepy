# grepy
A very simple python  script to get (GRE) word for today


## Usage
Just run the script `gre2.py`.

#### Add to bashrc
- Make sure `gre2.py` is executable which can be done using `chmod` command.  
- Add the end of the bashrc, just put the absolute path of this script like `/home/paradox/Nish/Programming/Python/projects/grepy/gre2.py`
- Reload the bashrc or open another terminal

Once setup is done, you can see **Today's** words whenever you open your terminal.

Cheers
